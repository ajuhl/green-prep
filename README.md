# GreenPrep

## Motivation

GreepPrep is a meal preparation web application, created with Django that determines the optimal serving sizes of user selected foods in order to meet nutrient goals for a meal. Our tool will make meal preparation quick, simple, and maintainable. The three main nutrients in all foods  are called macronutrients and include protein, carbohydrates, and fat. To maintain a healthy diet, you want to have a meal plan based on your specific macronutrient goals. Your macronutrient goals can be calculated using your gender, age, height, weight, activity level and your fitness goal for your diet whether it be losing fat, maintaining weight, or gaining muscle.
